# Predicting Superstore Sales using Time Series Analysis

## Project Overview:

This repository was created for the INFO 659 course at Drexel University, Introduction to Data Analytics.  The overall scope of this project was to predict sales numbers of Superstore from 2014-2015 using sales data from 2011-2014.  The Superstore dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jr2ngb/superstore-data).

## File Manifest: 

- `SuperstoreSalesPredictor.Rmd` - Main R code that predicts sales.
- `Folder /data` - Contains all data files
    - `superstore_dataset2011-2015.csv` - Raw sales data (source in **Project Overview**)
- `Folder /documents` - Cotains all miscellaneous documents

## Reason for Project:

## How to Execute Code: 

All of the code in this project needs to be opened with the Jupyter notebook environment. We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to help with Jupyter notebook.  Additionally, this code can be run in Google Colab or your preferred Python coding environment, assuming folder organization remains unchanged.
